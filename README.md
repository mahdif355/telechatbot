# TeleChatbot

TeleChatbot is a sophisticated Telegram chatbot designed to provide support and respond intelligently to inquiries regarding the Winter Seminar Series (WSS), an event hosted by Sharif University of Technology.

- **Intelligent Responses**: Employs OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo via LangChain to deliver context-aware, accurate answers.
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversational state, enabling coherent dialogue.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses FAISS vector stores for quick retrieval of relevant event details.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls request frequency to enhance user experience and system stability.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear instructions for unsupported interactions.
